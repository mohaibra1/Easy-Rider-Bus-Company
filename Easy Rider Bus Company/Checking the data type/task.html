<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>You just started sorting out the existing database of the "Easy Rider" bus company. As you take the first look at the data, you realize that it's not going to be easy.</p><p>The data that you're provided with has a lot of errors in it. Sometimes a field has no value inside it. You may notice in the example below that there are too many or too few characters in a particular field than required. Fortunately, there is documentation to help you sort out this mess. However, this documentation is not a hundred percent complete: part of it was torn away when your colleague spilled coffee on it. Let's see what we can make out.</p><p>Here are the documents that you have: <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/412967/Documentation.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/412967/Diagram_of_the_bus_line.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">diagram of the bus lines</a>. In this stage, you will need to work with the documentation and compare the fields in the input data with the requirements specified in the <strong>Type</strong> and <strong>Other</strong> columns.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ol><li><p>The string containing the data in JSON format is passed to standard input.</p></li><li><p>Check that the <strong>data types</strong> match<strong>.</strong></p></li><li><p>Check that the <strong>required fields</strong> are filled in.</p></li><li><p>Display the information about the number of found errors in total and in each field. Keep in mind that there might be no errors at all.</p></li><li><p>The output should have the same formatting as shown in the example.</p></li></ol><p> </p><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>No need to worry about the <strong>format</strong> (name validation) now. In this stage, let's just make sure that the fields have the right type and all required ones are filled.</p></div><p></p><p> </p><p>If you can't find the necessary information in the stage description, it can probably be found in the attached documentation.</p><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that non-required fields like <code class="language-json">stop_type</code> should have the correct data type when they are not empty. Thus, for <code class="language-json">stop_type</code>, which is of type Char, the field can be either empty or contain a single character (string).</p></div><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>Input:</p><pre><code class="language-json">[
